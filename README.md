Donations are crucial because they provide essential funding for charitable organizations and causes, enabling them to support those in need. 
They help address social issues, improve communities, and provide relief during emergencies. 
Donations also foster a culture of generosity and compassion, encouraging others to contribute and make a positive impact. 


Hence, we have created a simple donation mobile application that help people donate meals, clothes and essential products to the needy.
It mainly focuses on homeless women and children, given extra care to pre-pregnancy and post-pregnancy care.
